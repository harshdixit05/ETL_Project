# **ETL Pipeline Project**

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates a complete **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)** pipeline using **Microsoft Azure** tools. The pipeline processes data from raw CSV files stored in Azure Blob Storage, transforms it, and loads it into an **Azure SQL Database** for further analysis and reporting using **Power BI**.

The project is focused on enabling seamless data processing, ensuring data integrity, and providing actionable insights through data visualization.

---

## **Features**
- **Extraction:** Retrieves raw data from Azure Blob Storage.
- **Transformation:** Cleanses and processes the data using a structured pipeline.
- **Loading:** Loads the processed data into an Azure SQL Database.
- **Visualization:** Power BI dashboards for insights and analysis.
- **Collaboration:** Designed and executed as part of a data engineering team during an internship at Trent Ltd.

---

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Microsoft Azure**
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - Azure Data Factory
  - Azure SQL Database
- **Power BI**
  - Data modeling
  - Dashboard creation
- **Programming Languages**
  - Python (for minor script automation)
  - SQL (for querying and data manipulation)
- **Other Tools**
  - Excel (for manual data validation)
  - Visual Studio Code (for documentation and script writing)

---

## **Workflow**
1. **Extract**
   - CSV files containing raw data are stored in Azure Blob Storage.
   - Azure Data Factory pipelines retrieve the files for processing.
   
2. **Transform**
   - Data is cleaned and transformed using Azure Data Factory workflows.
   - Business logic is applied to derive meaningful insights from raw data.

3. **Load**
   - Transformed data is stored in Azure SQL Database for long-term storage and querying.

4. **Visualization**
   - Power BI connects to the Azure SQL Database.
   - Reports and dashboards are created to visualize trends and provide actionable insights.

---

## **Key Deliverables**
- **ETL Pipeline:** A fully functional pipeline capable of handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Power BI Dashboards:** Interactive dashboards showcasing key metrics and trends.
- **Documentation:** Includes detailed process workflows, project objectives, and challenges faced.

---

## **Challenges and Solutions**
- **Data Consistency:** Ensured data quality by implementing validation checks during the transformation stage.
- **Scalability:** Optimized Azure Data Factory pipelines for handling large data volumes.
- **Learning Curve:** Adapted quickly to Azure services by leveraging official documentation and tutorials.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Automating dashboard updates with real-time data integration.
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment of data pipelines.
- Adding advanced transformations using Python for more complex use cases.
